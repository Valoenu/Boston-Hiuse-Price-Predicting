# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System with RBM (PyTorch)

A Python-based movie recommendation system using **Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)** trained on the **MovieLens 1M dataset** with **PyTorch**.

## 📚 About the Project

This project is a collaborative filtering recommender system built from scratch. It leverages the power of **unsupervised learning** using **RBMs**, a type of generative stochastic neural network, to predict whether a user would like a movie based on past ratings.

> 🧠 Built as part of my machine learning learning journey as a software engineering student.
